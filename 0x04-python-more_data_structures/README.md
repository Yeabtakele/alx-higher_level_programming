# task 
* 1 Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.

Prototype: def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):
matrix is a 2 dimensional array
Returns a new matrix:
Same size as matrix
Each value should be the square of the value of the input
* 2 Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.

Prototype: def search_replace(my_list, search, replace):
my_list is the initial list
search is the element to replace in the list
replace is the new element
* 2 Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).

Prototype: def uniq_add(my_list=[])
* 3 Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.

Prototype: def common_elements(set_1, set_2):
* 4 Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.

Prototype: def only_diff_elements(set_1, set_2)
* 5 Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.

Prototype: def number_keys(a_dictionary):
* 6 Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.

Prototype: def print_sorted_dictionary(a_dictionary):
You can assume that all keys are strings
Keys should be sorted by alphabetic order
* 7 Write a function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.

Prototype: def update_dictionary(a_dictionary, key, value):
key argument will be always a string
value argument will be any type
* 8 Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.

Prototype: def simple_delete(a_dictionary, key=""):
key argument will be always a string
* 9 Write a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2

Prototype: def multiply_by_2(a_dictionary):
You can assume that all values are only integers
* 10 Write a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.

Prototype: def best_score(a_dictionary):
You can assume that all values are only integers
If no score found, return None
